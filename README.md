Farm Hack Foundation Narrative
==============================


The best agriculture has yet to be invented and will be more distributed, resilient and adaptive, and the process that produces it will be the same.  For the first time in human history, every human can communicate directly with every other human and share their observations, knowledge, skills and experiences - which gives every farm the potential to be a research farm.   

As farmers we know that we need to improve the tools we use to improve the farms we farm. We also know that the tools are only valuable in the hands of those skilled to use them, and that open source seeds, breeds and technology is the fastest way to accelerate the innovation and adaptation.  We believe that greater knowledge sharing will lead to improved tools, skills and biological insight to achieve our goals with elegance. 

As a result we're focused on the mechanics of improving our systems, as well as attracting into our community, and into the farm manufacturing economy those with relevant skill-sets: engineers, roboticists, designers, architects, fabricators, programmers, hackers-- who have problem-solving brainpower. We know that many of these skilled (and skill-aspirant) people are the key allies to turn ideas into tools into finished products.  By documenting, sharing and improving the tools we use, we can accelerate innovation, systems understanding and the productivity and health of our land that creates the abundance to feed and fuel our own communities.  

While we adapt the latest available technology and cool gadgets as part of our work, many of the technologies build on ancient solutions, and on biological approaches that use less energy, metal and electronics. Through collaboration we can substitute knowledge and skills for steel, labor and capital and create an agrarian economy that not only produces abundance, but also justice, liberty, and beauty.   A community that can provide for itself can stand firm in matters of moral principle and democracy.   

We know that the years ahead will see great change in nearly every system in our landscape. Farmers, local manufacturers, engineers, software developers, graphic designers, historians,  will be partners in monitoring those changes and adapting and developing resilient systems that work.   Farm Hack is a participatory and cumulative project that is as strong as we make it together. We Invite you to join.
